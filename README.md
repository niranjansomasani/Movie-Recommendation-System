# Movie-Recommendation-System

This is an attempt to build a Movie Recommendation System on Movielens Dataset from scratch without using much of the inbuilt python packages.
The analysis focusses more on how we can make the recommendations accurate and appropriate to the user which can be understood by anyone who's naive to the field rather than building robust model using some advanced packages/methods available at present.
This code displays the raw translation of math into coding and gives a very good understanding of how we can start off building recommendation systems further and improve the existing ones with the same data.
This is the code developed by me as a part of several independent projects that I've done under Prof. Dberndt.

Please let me know if you feel the need for any changes.

Thanks!
